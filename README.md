# Skyway Saver...
was created to give the visitors of Downtown Minneapolis and most notably, Prime Digital Academy students an easy way to not only find locations within the skyway but also how to use the skyway to get there!

## App Walk-through

### Landing page
When you first visit the site you're greeted with our the sign in page. For New users, they can fill out a simple form to join, one of the fields is a cohort name. This is something specific to Prime Digital Academy, The apps target demographic is Prime students so I wanted users to have an easy way of connecting with other users they see while using the app. The field however is optional, anyone is free to use Skyway Saver!

### Main View
After signing in, users can see a map view with location pins. currently Skyway Saver focuses on Food Locations. Just above the map is Search Bar, allowing users to search through locations on the map view. Below the main map, you can see a carousel of the locations shown on the map, for each location we have two buttons. The map button will highlight the locations marker giving the user a quick sense of where that locations is. The other button will take you to a Detail Page for that unique location. There is also a simple Nav bar, allowing quick access to the main views.

### Locations
Once on location view, there is a plethora of information we have to look at. For starters we can see the name of the location, A picture of the location in the Skyway, We can see the price rating for that specific restaurant as well as its Average rating score. Below the Location Information there are two buttons. One will show a Map View of the specific location in place fo the locations image which can be toggled on and off. the other allows users Create a review. Speaking of, just below, you can see Reviews left from other users! Each review will show the users name, the users cohort if they have one, the number rating that user gave that location and written description of their experience at said location.

### User Profile 
On the Profile, a user can see their basic information. Below that they can see all of the reviews that the have made. From here users can also edit any reviews they've made perhaps if they have had a different experience at the location. There is also the option to delete a review if it is no longer relevent.

The user page is one that I would love to add to, being able to show more about yourself would be a great way to make more connections both in a work and friendship sense.

### Advance Search
This feature is currently still in development, once create Users will be able to not only search locations but also filter results by different parameters such as Distance, Price rating, User rating, etc. This view would lack map availability and simply link to the Locations Pages
